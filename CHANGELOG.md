[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased] - 0.1.0

### Added

- `obsbot4linux` for the OBSBOT Tiny 2 Lite: every command with `--json`;
  commands tested byte for byte against OBSBOT Center captures.
- `obsbot4linux daemon` owns the camera state and broadcasts every change over
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/obsbot4linux.sock`; the CLI is a client of it and falls back
  to direct access. The camera is opened per operation, so video calls keep
  streaming.
- `obsbot4linux watch`: JSON lines for the DMS widget, state events out,
  requests in.
- Settings: sleep / wake, AI tracking mode and speed, HDR, exposure (global,
  face, manual over UVC), zoom, field of view, gimbal (Center's pose command),
  status LED, mirror, invert, auto-sleep, sleep background, audio, gestures,
  hand side, zone tracking with area and return position, image controls,
  autofocus, camera presets, start pose, factory reset.
- Live gimbal pose (query `0x6604`) in the status, read every second by the
  daemon.

### Changed

- Renamed from Tiny2Lite4Linux / `t2l` to OBSBot4Linux / `obsbot4linux`, so further OBSBOT
  models can join as modules.

### Fixed

- Selecting global or face exposure no longer freezes the automatic exposure
  (a manual-exposure frame was sent along).
